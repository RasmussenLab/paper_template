              mechanisms in order to thrive in most environments. In this

  abstract = "The recovery of DNA from viromes is a major obstacle in the use
              of long-read sequencing to study their genomes. For this reason,
              the use of cellular metagenomes (>0.2-$\mu$m size range) emerges
              as an interesting complementary tool, since they contain large
              amounts of naturally amplified viral genomes from prelytic
              replication. We have applied second-generation (Illumina NextSeq;
              short reads) and third-generation (PacBio Sequel II; long reads)
              sequencing to compare the diversity and features of the viral
              community in a marine sample obtained from offshore waters of the
              western Mediterranean. We found that a major wedge of the
              expected marine viral diversity was directly recovered by the raw
              PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads. More than
              30,000 sequences were detected only in this data set, with no
              homologues in the long- and short-read assembly, and ca. 26,000
              had no homologues in the large data set of the Global Ocean
              Virome 2 (GOV2), highlighting the information gap created by the
              assembly bias. At the level of complete viral genomes, the
              performance was similar in both approaches. However, the hybrid
              long- and short-read assembly provided the longest average length
              of the sequences and improved the host assignment. Although no
              novel major clades of viruses were found, there was an increase
              in the intraclade genomic diversity recovered by long reads that
              produced an enriched assessment of the real diversity and allowed
              the discovery of novel genes with biotechnological potential
              (e.g., endolysin genes). IMPORTANCE We explored the vast genetic
              diversity of environmental viruses by using a combination of
              cellular metagenome (as opposed to virome) sequencing using
              high-fidelity long-read sequences (in this case, PacBio CCS).
              This approach resulted in the recovery of a representative sample
              of the viral population, and it performed better (more phage
              contigs, larger average contig size) than Illumina sequencing
              applied to the same sample. By this approach, the many biases of
              assembly are avoided, as the CCS reads recovers (typically around
              5 kb) complete genes and even operons, resulting in a better
              discovery of the viral gene diversity based on viral marker
              proteins. Thus, biotechnologically promising genes, such as
              endolysin genes, can be very efficiently searched with this
              approach. In addition, hybrid assembly produces more complete and
              longer contigs, which is particularly important for studying
              little-known viral groups such as the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA
              viruses (NCLDV).",

              virulent and temperate phage-derived sequences in metavirome data
              is important for elucidating their different roles in
              interactions with bacterial hosts and regulation of microbial
              communities. However, there is no experimental or computational
              approach to effectively classify their sequences in

              method, DeePhage, which can directly and rapidly judge each read
              or contig as a virulent or temperate phage-derived fragment.
              FINDINGS: DeePhage uses a ``one-hot'' encoding form to represent
              DNA sequences in detail. Sequence signatures are detected via a
              convolutional neural network to obtain valuable local features.
              The accuracy of DeePhage on 5-fold cross-validation reaches as

              810 times, respectively, under the same computational
              configuration. By direct detection of the temperate viral
              fragments from metagenome and metavirome, we furthermore propose
              a new strategy to explore phage transformations in the microbial
              community. The ability to detect such transformations provides us
              a new insight into the potential treatment for human disease.
              CONCLUSIONS: DeePhage is a novel tool developed to rapidly and
              efficiently identify 2 kinds of phage fragments especially for

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The colonic inner mucus layer protects us from
              pathogens and commensal-induced inflammation, and has been shown
              to be defective in active UC. The aim of this study was to
              determine the underlying compositional alterations, their
              molecular background and potential contribution to UC
              pathogenesis. DESIGN: In this single-centre case-control study,
              sigmoid colon biopsies were obtained from patients with UC with
              ongoing inflammation (n=36) or in remission (n=28), and from 47
              patients without colonic disease. Mucus samples were collected
              from biopsies ex vivo, and their protein composition analysed by
              nanoliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Mucus
              penetrability and goblet cell responses to microbial stimulus
              were assessed in a subset of patients. RESULTS: The core mucus
              proteome was found to consist of a small set of 29
              secreted/transmembrane proteins. In active UC, major structural
              mucus components including the mucin MUC2 (p<0.0001) were
              reduced, also in non-inflamed segments. Active UC was associated
              with decreased numbers of sentinel goblet cells and attenuation
              of the goblet cell secretory response to microbial challenge.
              Abnormal penetrability of the inner mucus layer was observed in a
              subset of patients with UC (12/40; 30\%). Proteomic alterations
              in penetrable mucus samples included a reduction of the SLC26A3
              apical membrane anion exchanger, which supplies bicarbonate
              required for colonic mucin barrier formation. CONCLUSION: Core
              mucus structural components were reduced in active UC. These
              alterations were associated with attenuation of the goblet cell
              secretory response to microbial challenge, but occurred
              independent of local inflammation. Thus, mucus abnormalities are
              likely to contribute to UC pathogenesis.",

              features presents new challenges, and validated computational
              tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification
              rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing
              questions about the generality and generalization of
              disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we
              comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based
              prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength
              of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a
              computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative
              microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances
              and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive
              meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across
              cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available
              metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies.
              Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities,
              which were in general improved by feature selection and use of
              strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic
              abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between
              studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by
              within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of
              healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets
              improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species

              identification is critical for determining the role of individual
              phage species within ecosystems and their effect on host
              evolution. Results Here, we present BACPHLIP, a BACterioPHage
              LIfestyle Predictor. BACPHLIP detects the presence of a set of
              conserved protein domains within an input genome and uses this
              data to predict lifestyle via a Random Forest classifier. The
              classifier was trained on 634 phage genomes. On an independent
              test set of 423 phages, BACPHLIP has an accuracy of 98\%, greatly
              exceeding that of the best existing available tool (79\%).
              Availability BACPHLIP is freely available on GitHub () and the
              code used to build and test the classifier is provided in a
              separate repository (). \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The

               community initiative presents results from its first challenge,
               a rigorous benchmarking of software for metagenome assembly,
               binning and taxonomic profiling. Methods for assembly, taxonomic
               profiling and binning are key to interpreting metagenome data,
               but a lack of consensus about benchmarking complicates
               performance assessment. The Critical Assessment of Metagenome
               Interpretation (CAMI) challenge has engaged the global developer
               community to benchmark their programs on highly complex and
               realistic data sets, generated from ∼700 newly sequenced
               microorganisms and ∼600 novel viruses and plasmids and
               representing common experimental setups. Assembly and genome
               binning programs performed well for species represented by
               individual genomes but were substantially affected by the
               presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning
               programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable
               performance decrease below family level. Parameter settings
               markedly affected performance, underscoring their importance for
               program reproducibility. The CAMI results highlight current

              are the raw material of evolution[1][1]. The frequency and
              location of mutations can be constrained by specific molecular
              mechanisms, such as Diversity-generating retroelements
              (DGRs)[2][2]--[4][3]. DGRs introduce mutations in specific target
              genes, and were characterized from several cultivated bacteria
              and bacteriophages[2][2]. Whilst a larger diversity of DGR loci
              has been identified in genomic data from environmental samples,
              i.e. metagenomes, the ecological role of these DGRs and their
              associated evolutionary drivers remain poorly
              understood[5][4]--[7][5]. Here we built and analyzed an extensive
              dataset of >30,000 metagenome-derived DGRs, and determine that
              DGRs have a single evolutionary origin and a universal bias
              towards adenine mutations. We further identified six major
              lineages of DGRs, each associated with a specific ecological
              niche defined as a genome type, i.e. whether the DGR is encoded
              on a viral or cellular genome, a limited set of taxa and
              environments, and a distinct type of target. Finally, we leverage
              read mapping and metagenomic time series to demonstrate that DGRs
              are consistently and broadly active, and responsible for >10\% of
              all amino acid changes in some organisms at a conservative
              estimate. Overall, these results highlight the strong constraints

              shaping microbial community structure and function in our

  abstract = "Humans are virtually identical in their genetic makeup, yet the
              small differences in our DNA give rise to tremendous phenotypic
              diversity across the human population. By contrast, the
              metagenome of the human microbiome-the total DNA content of
              microbes inhabiting our bodies-is quite a bit more variable, with
              only a third of its constituent genes found in a majority of
              healthy individuals. Understanding this variability in the
              ``healthy microbiome'' has thus been a major challenge in
              microbiome research, dating back at least to the 1960s,
              continuing through the Human Microbiome Project and beyond.
              Cataloguing the necessary and sufficient sets of microbiome
              features that support health, and the normal ranges of these
              features in healthy populations, is an essential first step to
              identifying and correcting microbial configurations that are
              implicated in disease. Toward this goal, several population-scale
              studies have documented the ranges and diversity of both
              taxonomic compositions and functional potentials normally
              observed in the microbiomes of healthy populations, along with
              possible driving factors such as geography, diet, and lifestyle.
              Here, we review several definitions of a 'healthy microbiome'
              that have emerged, the current understanding of the ranges of
              healthy microbial diversity, and gaps such as the

              via phage proteins is not used for carbon fixation. We report
              here that cyanophages carry and express a Calvin cycle inhibitor,
              CP12, whose host homologue directs carbon flux from the Calvin
              cycle to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Phage CP12 was
              coexpressed with phage genes involved in the light reactions,
              deoxynucleotide biosynthesis, and the PPP, including a
              transaldolase gene that is the most prevalent PPP gene in
              cyanophages. Phage transaldolase was purified to homogeneity from
              several strains and shown to be functional in vitro, suggesting
              that it might facilitate increased flux through this key reaction
              in the host PPP, augmenting production of NADPH and ribose
              5-phosphate. Kinetic measurements of phage and host
              transaldolases revealed that the phage enzymes have k(cat)/K(m)
              values only approximately one third of the corresponding host
              enzymes. The lower efficiency of phage transaldolase may be a
              tradeoff for other selective advantages such as reduced gene
              size: we show that more than half of host-like cyanophage genes
              are significantly shorter than their host homologues. Consistent
              with decreased Calvin cycle activity and increased PPP and light
              reaction activity under infection, the host NADPH/NADP ratio
              increased two-fold in infected cells. We propose that
              phage-augmented NADPH production fuels deoxynucleotide
              biosynthesis for phage replication, and that the selection
              pressures molding phage genomes involve fitness advantages

              challenge. In four geographically distinct IBD cohorts (n = 537),
              we identify a clade of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) strains,
              featuring a unique antibiotics resistance and mobilome signature,
              to be strongly associated with disease exacerbation and severity.
              Transfer of clinical IBD-associated Kp strains into
              colitis-prone, germ-free, and colonized mice enhances intestinal
              inflammation. Stepwise generation of a lytic five-phage
              combination, targeting sensitive and resistant IBD-associated Kp
              clade members through distinct mechanisms, enables effective Kp
              suppression in colitis-prone mice, driving an attenuated
              inflammation and disease severity. Proof-of-concept assessment of
              Kp-targeting phages in an artificial human gut and in healthy
              volunteers demonstrates gastric acid-dependent phage resilience,
              safety, and viability in the lower gut. Collectively, we
              demonstrate the feasibility of orally administered combination
              phage therapy in avoiding resistance, while effectively
              inhibiting non-communicable disease-contributing pathobionts.",

              appreciate their ecological impact, it is important to determine

              longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity
              during disease (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool,

              recovered an average of 94\% of the viruses, whereas VirFinder,
              VirSorter, and MARVEL achieved less powerful performance,
              averaging 48\%, 87\%, and 71\%, respectively. Similarly, VIBRANT
              identified more total viral sequence and proteins when applied to
              real metagenomes. When compared to PHASTER, Prophage Hunter, and
              VirSorter for the ability to extract integrated provirus regions
              from host scaffolds, VIBRANT performed comparably and even
              identified proviruses that the other programs did not. To
              demonstrate applications of VIBRANT, we studied viromes
              associated with Crohn's disease to show that specific viral
              groups, namely Enterobacteriales-like viruses, as well as
              putative dysbiosis associated viral proteins are more abundant
              compared to healthy individuals, providing a possible viral link
              to maintenance of diseased states. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to
              accurately recover viruses and explore viral impacts on microbial
              community metabolism will greatly advance our understanding of
              microbiomes, host-microbe interactions, and ecosystem dynamics.

              most products of an uncharacterized genome. Bacterial genomes
              differ vastly in their gene repertoires. Although genes for
              components of the translation and transcription machinery, and
              for molecular chaperones, are typically maintained, many
              regulatory and metabolic systems are absent in bacteria with
              small genomes. Mycoplasma genitalium, with the smallest known
              genome of any cellular life form, lacks virtually all known
              regulatory genes, and its gene expression may be regulated
              differently than in other bacteria. Genome organization is
              evolutionarily labile: extensive gene shuffling leaves only very

              paradigm for developmental genetic networks. There are three key
              features, which characterize the network. First, after infection
              of the host bacterium, a decision between lytic or lysogenic
              development is made that is dependent upon environmental signals
              and the number of infecting phages per cell. Second, the
              lysogenic prophage state is very stable. Third, the prophage
              enters lytic development in response to DNA-damaging agents. The
              CI and Cro regulators define the lysogenic and lytic states,
              respectively, as a bistable genetic switch. Whereas CI maintains
              a stable lysogenic state, recent studies indicate that Cro sets
              the lytic course not by directly blocking CI expression but
              indirectly by lowering levels of CII which activates cI
              transcription. We discuss how a relatively simple phage like

              we demonstrate that, starting in mid-to-late adulthood, gut
              microbiomes become increasingly unique to individuals with age.
              We leverage three independent cohorts comprising over 9,000

              associated with microbially produced amino acid derivatives

              healthy individuals show continued microbial drift towards a
              unique compositional state, whereas this drift is absent in less
              healthy individuals. The identified microbiome pattern of healthy

               respiratory viral infections, insulin-resistant participants
               respond differently than insulin-sensitive participants. Third,
               global co-association analyses among the thousands of profiled

              benefit bacteria by serving as a refuge from parasitic
              infections. Here we focus on dormancy in the Firmicutes , where
              endospore development is transcriptionally regulated by the
              expression of sigma factors. A disruption of this process could
              influence the survivorship and reproduction of phages that infect
              spore-forming hosts with implications for coevolutionary
              dynamics. Here, we characterized the distribution and diversity
              of sigma factors in nearly 3,500 phage genomes. Homologs of
              sporulation-specific sigma factors were identified in phages that
              infect spore-forming hosts. Unlike sigma factors required for
              phage reproduction, the sporulation-like sigma factors were

              activated the bacterial sporulation gene network and reduced
              spore yield. Our findings suggest that the acquisition of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Polymorphic toxins (PTs) are multi-domain bacterial
              exotoxins belonging to distinct families that share common
              features in terms of domain organization. PTs are found in all
              major bacterial clades, including many toxic effectors of type V
              and type VI secretion systems. PTs modulate the dynamics of
              microbial communities by killing or inhibiting the growth of
              bacterial competitors lacking protective immunity proteins.
              RESULTS: In this work, we identified a novel widespread family of
              PTs, named MuF toxins, which were exclusively encoded within
              temperate phages and their prophages. By analyzing the predicted
              proteomes of 1845 bacteriophages and 2464 bacterial genomes, we
              found that MuF-containing proteins were frequently part of the
              DNA packaging module of tailed phages. Interestingly, MuF toxins
              were abundant in the human gut microbiome. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              results uncovered the presence of the MuF toxin family in the
              temperate phages of Firmicutes. The MuF toxin family is likely to
              play an important role in the ecology of the human microbiota
              where pathogens and commensal species belonging to the Firmicutes

              phages into host bacteria and either influence the lysogeny

              of competing bacteria.",

              Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of
              around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this
              represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein
              sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months
              to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single
              protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed
              to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural
              bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a
              protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the
              structure prediction component of the 'protein folding
              problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more
              than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods
              fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous
              structure is available. Here we provide the first computational
              method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic
              accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We
              validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Laterally transferred genes have often been
              identified on the basis of compositional features that
              distinguish them from ancestral genes in the genome. These genes
              are usually A+T-rich, arguing either that there is a bias towards
              acquiring genes from donor organisms having low G+C contents or
              that genes acquired from organisms of similar genomic base
              compositions go undetected in these analyses. RESULTS: By
              examining the genome contents of closely related, fully sequenced
              bacteria, we uncovered genes confined to a single genome and
              examined the sequence features of these acquired genes. The
              analysis shows that few transfer events are overlooked by
              compositional analyses. Most observed lateral gene transfers do
              not correspond to free exchange of regular genes among bacterial
              genomes, but more probably represent the constituents of phages
              or other selfish elements. CONCLUSIONS: Although bacteria tend to
              acquire large amounts of DNA, the origin of these genes remains
              obscure. We have shown that contrary to what is often supposed,
              their composition cannot be explained by a previous genomic
              context. In contrast, these genes fit the description of recently
              described genes in lambdoid phages, named 'morons'. Therefore,
              results from genome content and compositional approaches to
              detect lateral transfers should not be cited as evidence for

  abstract = "Viruses of microbes impact all ecosystems where microbes drive
              key energy and substrate transformations including the oceans,
              humans and industrial fermenters. However, despite this
              recognized importance, our understanding of viral diversity and
              impacts remains limited by too few model systems and reference
              genomes. One way to fill these gaps in our knowledge of viral
              diversity is through the detection of viral signal in microbial
              genomic data. While multiple approaches have been developed and
              applied for the detection of prophages (viral genomes integrated
              in a microbial genome), new types of microbial genomic data are
              emerging that are more fragmented and larger scale, such as
              Single-cell Amplified Genomes (SAGs) of uncultivated organisms or
              genomic fragments assembled from metagenomic sequencing. Here, we
              present VirSorter, a tool designed to detect viral signal in
              these different types of microbial sequence data in both a
              reference-dependent and reference-independent manner, leveraging
              probabilistic models and extensive virome data to maximize
              detection of novel viruses. Performance testing shows that
              VirSorter's prophage prediction capability compares to that of
              available prophage predictors for complete genomes, but is
              superior in predicting viral sequences outside of a host genome
              (i.e., from extrachromosomal prophages, lytic infections, or
              partially assembled prophages). Furthermore, VirSorter
              outperforms existing tools for fragmented genomic and metagenomic
              datasets, and can identify viral signal in assembled sequence
              (contigs) as short as 3kb, while providing near-perfect
              identification (>95\% Recall and 100\% Precision) on contigs of
              at least 10kb. Because VirSorter scales to large datasets, it can
              also be used in ``reverse'' to more confidently identify viral
              sequence in viral metagenomes by sorting away cellular DNA
              whether derived from gene transfer agents, generalized
              transduction or contamination. Finally, VirSorter is made
              available through the iPlant Cyberinfrastructure that provides a
              web-based user interface interconnected with the required
              computing resources. VirSorter thus complements existing prophage
              prediction softwares to better leverage fragmented, SAG and
              metagenomic datasets in a way that will scale to modern
              sequencing. Given these features, VirSorter should enable the
              discovery of new viruses in microbial datasets, and further our
              understanding of uncultivated viral communities across diverse
              ecosystems.",

               centuries, limiting their direct influence on the history of
               biology; but work in the twentieth century confirmed
               Leeuwenhoek's discovery of bacterial cells, with a resolution of
               less than 1 µm. Leeuwenhoek delighted most in the forms,

              mucus layer is the habitat for commensal bacteria. The inner
              mucus layer is impervious to bacteria and is renewed every hour
              by surface goblet cells. The crypt goblet cells have the ability
              to restitute the mucus layer by secretion, for example after an
              ischaemic challenge. Proteases of certain parasites and some
              bacteria can cleave mucins and dissolve the mucus as part of
              their pathogenicity. The inner mucus layer can, however, also
              become penetrable to bacteria by several other mechanisms,
              including aberrations in the immune system. When bacteria reach
              the epithelial surface, the immune system is activated and
              inflammation is triggered. This mechanism might occur in some
              types of ulcerative colitis.",

              bacterial hosts and with the mucus-covered epithelium remain
              mostly unexplored. Our previous work demonstrated that T4 phage
              with Hoc proteins exposed on their capsid adhered to mucin
              glycoproteins and protected mucus-producing tissue culture cells
              in vitro. On this basis, we proposed our bacteriophage adherence
              to mucus (BAM) model of immunity. Here, to test this model, we
              developed a microfluidic device (chip) that emulates a mucosal
              surface experiencing constant fluid flow and mucin secretion
              dynamics. Using mucus-producing human cells and Escherichia coli
              in the chip, we observed similar accumulation and persistence of
              mucus-adherent T4 phage and nonadherent T4∆hoc phage in the
              mucus. Nevertheless, T4 phage reduced bacterial colonization of
              the epithelium >4,000-fold compared with T4∆hoc phage. This
              suggests that phage adherence to mucus increases encounters with
              bacterial hosts by some other mechanism. Phages are traditionally
              thought to be completely dependent on normal diffusion, driven by
              random Brownian motion, for host contact. We demonstrated that T4
              phage particles displayed subdiffusive motion in mucus, whereas
              T4∆hoc particles displayed normal diffusion. Experiments and
              modeling indicate that subdiffusive motion increases phage-host
              encounters when bacterial concentration is low. By concentrating
              phages in an optimal mucus zone, subdiffusion increases their
              host encounters and antimicrobial action. Our revised BAM model
              proposes that the fundamental mechanism of mucosal immunity is
              subdiffusion resulting from adherence to mucus. These findings
              suggest intriguing possibilities for engineering phages to

              been recognised as direct modulators of the gut microbiome, and
              indirectly of host health and disease. Despite recent advances in
              studying prophages using non-targeted sequencing approaches,
              methodological challenges in identifying inducible prophages in
              bacterial genomes and quantifying their activity have limited our
              understanding of prophage-host interactions. RESULTS: We present
              methods for using high-throughput sequencing data to locate
              inducible prophages, including those previously undiscovered, to
              quantify prophage activity and to investigate their replication.
              We first used the well-established Salmonella enterica serovar
              Typhimurium/p22 system to validate our methods for (i)
              quantifying phage-to-host ratios and (ii) accurately locating
              inducible prophages in the reference genome based on
              phage-to-host ratio differences and read alignment alterations
              between induced and non-induced prophages. Investigating
              prophages in bacterial strains from a murine gut model microbiota
              known as Oligo-MM12 or sDMDMm2, we located five novel inducible
              prophages in three strains, quantified their activity and showed
              signatures of lateral transduction potential for two of them.
              Furthermore, we show that the methods were also applicable to
              metagenomes of induced faecal samples from Oligo-MM12 mice,
              including for strains with a relative abundance below 1\%,
              illustrating its potential for the discovery of inducible
              prophages also in more complex metagenomes. Finally, we show that
              predictions of prophage locations in reference genomes of the
              strains we studied were variable and inconsistent for four
              bioinformatic tools we tested, which highlights the importance of
              their experimental validation. CONCLUSIONS: This study
              demonstrates that the integration of experimental induction and

              associated with gut microbiota (GM) changes. The gut viral
              community is predominated by bacteriophages (phages), which are
              viruses that attack bacteria in a host-specific manner. The
              antagonistic behaviour of phages has the potential to alter the
              GM. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the efficacy of faecal
              virome transplantation (FVT) from lean donors for shifting the
              phenotype of obese mice into closer resemblance of lean mice.
              DESIGN: The FVT consisted of viromes with distinct profiles
              extracted from the caecal content of mice from different vendors
              that were fed a low-fat (LF) diet for 14 weeks. Male C57BL/6NTac
              mice were divided into five groups: LF (as diet control),
              high-fat (HF) diet, HF+ampicillin (Amp), HF+Amp+FVT and HF+FVT.
              At weeks 6 and 7 of the study, the HF+FVT and HF+Amp+FVT mice
              were treated with FVT by oral gavage. The Amp groups were treated
              with Amp 24 hours prior to first FVT treatment. RESULTS: Six
              weeks after first FVT, the HF+FVT mice showed a significant
              decrease in weight gain compared with the HF group. Further,
              glucose tolerance was comparable between the LF and HF+FVT mice,
              while the other HF groups all had impaired glucose tolerance.
              These observations were supported by significant shifts in GM
              composition, blood plasma metabolome and expression levels of
              genes associated with obesity and T2D development. CONCLUSIONS:
              Transfer of caecal viral communities from mice with a lean
              phenotype into mice with an obese phenotype led to reduced weight
              gain and normalised blood glucose parameters relative to lean
              mice. We hypothesise that this effect is mediated via FVT-induced

              complete and higher fidelity genome bins than other currently
              used methods, which are primarily based on sequence composition.

              microbiota in all habitats, including the human gut. MAIN BODY:
              Here we review approaches for studying the human virome, and some
              recent results on movement of viral sequences between bacterial
              cells and eukaryotic hosts. We first overview biochemical and
              bioinformatic methods, emphasizing that specific choices in the
              methods used can have strong effects on the results obtained. We
              then review studies characterizing the virome of the healthy
              human gut, which reveal that most of the viruses detected are
              typically uncharacterized phage - the viral dark matter - and
              that viruses that infect human cells are encountered only rarely.
              We then review movement of phage between bacterial cells during
              antibiotic treatment. Here a radical proposal for extensive
              movement of antibiotic genes on phage has been challenged by a
              careful reanalysis of the metagenomic annotation methods used. We
              then review two recent studies of movement of whole phage
              communities between human individuals during fecal microbial
              transplantation, which emphasize the possible role of lysogeny in
              dispersal. SHORT CONCLUSION: Methods for studying the human gut
              virome are improving, yielding interesting data on movement of
              phage genes between cells and mammalian host organisms. However,
              viral populations are vast, and studies of their composition and

              our digestive machinery, and large amounts of microorganisms.
              Mucus is the first line of defense and aids to limit exposure to
              all these threats to the epithelium. In the small intestine,
              mucus acts as a matrix, which contains antimicrobial products,
              such as defensins and immunoglobulin A that limit epithelial
              exposure to the luminal bacteria. In the colon, the stratified

              access to longer DNA fragments than previous sequencer
              generations, at the cost of a higher error rate. While many
              papers have studied read correction methods, few have addressed
              the detailed characterization of observed errors, a task
              complicated by frequent changes in chemistry and software in ONT
              technology. The MinION sequencer is now more stable and this
              paper proposes an up-to-date view of its error landscape, using
              the most mature flowcell and basecaller. We studied Nanopore
              sequencing error biases on both bacterial and human DNA reads. We
              found that, although Nanopore sequencing is expected not to
              suffer from GC bias, it is a crucial parameter with respect to
              errors. In particular, low-GC reads have fewer errors than
              high-GC reads (about 6\% and 8\% respectively). The error profile
              for homopolymeric regions or regions with short repeats, the
              source of about half of all sequencing errors, also depends on
              the GC rate and mainly shows deletions, although there are some
              reads with long insertions. Another interesting finding is that
              the quality measure, although over-estimated, offers valuable
              information to predict the error rate as well as the abundance of
              reads. We supplemented this study with an analysis of a rapeseed
              RNA read set and shown a higher level of errors with a higher
              level of deletion in these data. Finally, we have implemented an

              binning software tool to reconstruct single genomes from
              microbial communities for subsequent analyses of uncultivated
              microbial species. MetaBAT has become one of the most popular
              binning tools largely due to its computational efficiency and
              ease of use, especially in binning experiments with a large
              number of samples and a large assembly. MetaBAT requires users to
              choose parameters to fine-tune its sensitivity and specificity.
              If those parameters are not chosen properly, binning accuracy can
              suffer, especially on assemblies of poor quality. Here, we
              developed MetaBAT 2 to overcome this problem. MetaBAT 2 uses a
              new adaptive binning algorithm to eliminate manual parameter
              tuning. We also performed extensive software engineering
              optimization to increase both computational and memory
              efficiency. Comparing MetaBAT 2 to alternative software tools on
              over 100 real world metagenome assemblies shows superior accuracy
              and computing speed. Binning a typical metagenome assembly takes
              only a few minutes on a single commodity workstation. We
              therefore recommend the community adopts MetaBAT 2 for their
              metagenome binning experiments. MetaBAT 2 is open source software

              heterogeneity in bacteriophages from healthy individuals. To
              better estimate and identify the shared phageome of humans, we
              analyzed a deep DNA sequence dataset of active bacteriophages and
              available metagenomic datasets of the gut bacteriophage community
              from healthy individuals. We found 23 shared bacteriophages in
              more than one-half of 64 healthy individuals from around the
              world. These shared bacteriophages were found in a significantly
              smaller percentage of individuals with gastrointestinal/irritable

              groups of which 9 (20\%) were shared in more than one-half of all
              64 individuals. These results provide strong evidence of a
              healthy gut phageome (HGP) in humans. The bacteriophage community
              in the human gut is a mixture of three classes: a set of core

              a novel transformation of the oligonucleotide frequency-derived
              error gradient and GC content to generate coarse groups at the

               option for dealing with these multidrug-resistant microbes and
               so new approaches are needed. Bacteriophage-derived proteins
               such as endolysins could offer one effective solution.
               Endolysins are bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases
               that act to lyse bacterial cells by targeting their cell's wall,
               particularly in Gram-positive bacteria due to their naturally
               exposed peptidoglycan layer. These lytic enzymes have received
               much interest from the scientific community in recent years for
               their specificity, mode of action, potential for engineering,
               and lack of resistance mechanisms. Over the past decade, a
               renewed interest in endolysin therapy has led to a number of
               successful applications. Recombinant endolysins have been shown
               to be effective against prominent pathogens such as MRSA,
               Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus strains in biofilm
               formation, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Endolysins have also been
               studied in combination with other antimicrobials, giving a
               synergistic effect. Although endolysin therapy comes with some
               regulatory and logistical hurdles, the future looks promising,
               with the emergence of engineered ``next-generation'' lysins.
               This review will focus on the likelihood that endolysins will
               become a viable new antimicrobial therapy and the challenges

              laboratory protocols, replicate numbers, and sequencing
              technologies. Accordingly, to effectively assess the performance
              of metagenomic analysis software, a wide range of benchmark data
              sets are required. RESULTS: We describe the CAMISIM microbial
              community and metagenome simulator. The software can model
              different microbial abundance profiles, multi-sample time series,
              and differential abundance studies, includes real and simulated
              strain-level diversity, and generates second- and
              third-generation sequencing data from taxonomic profiles or de
              novo. Gold standards are created for sequence assembly, genome
              binning, taxonomic binning, and taxonomic profiling. CAMSIM
              generated the benchmark data sets of the first CAMI challenge.
              For two simulated multi-sample data sets of the human and mouse
              gut microbiomes, we observed high functional congruence to the
              real data. As further applications, we investigated the effect of
              varying evolutionary genome divergence, sequencing depth, and
              read error profiles on two popular metagenome assemblers,
              MEGAHIT, and metaSPAdes, on several thousand small data sets

              (months 3-14), a transitional phase (months 15-30), and a stable

              levels of Bifidobacterium species (B. breve and B. bifidum), and
              the cessation of breast milk resulted in faster maturation of the
              gut microbiome, as marked by the phylum Firmicutes. Birth mode
              was also significantly associated with the microbiome during the

  abstract = "The human gut is a dense microbial community, of which bacteria
              and bacteriophages are the majority. Bacteriophages, viruses of
              bacteria, exist stably, without major fluctuations in the gut of
              healthy individuals. This stability appears to be due to an
              absence of `kill-the-winner' dynamics, and the existence of
              `piggy-back-the-winner' dynamics, where lysogenic replication
              rather than lytic replication occurs. Revisiting the deep-viral
              sequencing data of a healthy individual studied over 2.4 years,
              we were able to improve our understanding of how these dynamics
              occur in healthy individuals. We assembled prophages from
              bacterial metagenomic data and show that these prophages were
              continually switching from lysogenic to lytic replication.
              Prophages were the source of a stable extracellular phage
              population continually present in low abundance, in comparison to
              the lytic-phage population, where taxonomic diversity diverged
              over 2.4 years. The switch to lytic replication, or prophage
              induction, appears to occur mostly through spontaneous prophage
              induction. The observed phage dynamics of regular spontaneous
              induction are ecologically important as they allow prophages to
              maintain their ability to replicate, avoiding degradation and
              their loss from the gut microbiota. Significance Statement It has
              been eight years since Minot and colleagues published their
              landmark longitudinal study of phages in the gut. In the years
              following, the bioinformatic field improved in great strides,
              including the methods of bacterial-genome assembly,
              phage-identification, and prophage detection. We leveraged the
              unprecedented deep sequencing of phages in this dataset by adding
              bacterial assembly and prophage detection analyzes. We show
              clearly for the first time that `piggy-back-the-winner' dynamics
              are maintained in the gut through spontaneous prophage induction,
              and not widespread triggered prophage induction. These dynamics
              play an important ecological role by creating a stable
              subpopulation of phages, which could help explain how phages are
              maintained over the 2.4 years timeframe that this individual was

              deep-ocean viruses sampled during the Tara Oceans and Malaspina
              research expeditions, and analyse the resulting 'global ocean
              virome' dataset to present a global map of abundant,
              double-stranded DNA viruses complete with genomic and ecological
              contexts. A total of 15,222 epipelagic and mesopelagic viral
              populations were identified, comprising 867 viral clusters
              (defined as approximately genus-level groups). This roughly
              triples the number of known ocean viral populations and doubles
              the number of candidate bacterial and archaeal virus genera,
              providing a near-complete sampling of epipelagic communities at
              both the population and viral-cluster level. We found that 38 of
              the 867 viral clusters were locally or globally abundant,
              together accounting for nearly half of the viral populations in
              any global ocean virome sample. While two-thirds of these
              clusters represent newly described viruses lacking any cultivated
              representative, most could be computationally linked to dominant,
              ecologically relevant microbial hosts. Moreover, we identified
              243 viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes, of which only 95
              were previously known. Deeper analyses of four of these auxiliary
              metabolic genes (dsrC, soxYZ, P-II (also known as glnB) and amoC)
              revealed that abundant viruses may directly manipulate sulfur and

  abstract  = "Temperate viruses can become dormant in their host cells, a
               process called lysogeny. In every infection, such viruses decide
               between the lytic and the lysogenic cycles, that is, whether to
               replicate and lyse their host or to lysogenize and keep the host
               viable. Here we show that viruses (phages) of the SPbeta group
               use a small-molecule communication system to coordinate
               lysis--lysogeny decisions. During infection of its Bacillus host
               cell, the phage produces a six amino-acids-long communication
               peptide that is released into the medium. In subsequent
               infections, progeny phages measure the concentration of this
               peptide and lysogenize if the concentration is sufficiently
               high. We found that different phages encode different versions
               of the communication peptide, demonstrating a phage-specific
               peptide communication code for lysogeny decisions. We term this
               communication system the `arbitrium' system, and further show
               that it is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces
               the peptide; aimR, the intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX,
               a negative regulator of lysogeny. The arbitrium system enables a
               descendant phage to `communicate' with its predecessors, that
               is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and
               hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle.
               Some phages---viruses that infect bacteria---encode peptides
               that are secreted from infected cells and that, beyond a certain
               threshold, stimulate other viruses to switch from the lytic
               (killing the host cell) to lysogenic (dormant) phase. Bacteria
               secrete signalling molecules that allow them to perceive their
               population density and change their behaviour accordingly. In an
               exciting turn of events, while searching for bacterial
               communication systems, Rotem Sorek and colleagues found that
               some phages---viruses that infect bacteria---encode peptides
               that are secreted from infected cells and sensed by the viral
               population. Beyond a certain threshold, the viruses switch from
               employing the lytic cycle, in which they kill the host cell, to
               the lysogenic cycle, in which they avoid killing off their
               hosts. This is the first viral communication system to have been

              Fluorescent staining of virus-like particles purified from infant
              meconium or early stool samples shows few or no particles, but by
              one month of life particle numbers increase to 109 per gram, and

              Results indicate that, early after birth, pioneer bacteria

              remarkable diversity of phages at the nucleotide sequence level,
              the structural proteins that form viral particles show strong
              similarities and conservation. Phages are uniquely interconnected
              from an evolutionary perspective and undergo multiple events of
              genetic exchange in response to the selective pressure of their
              hosts, which drives their diversity. In this Review, we explore
              phage diversity at the structural, genomic and community levels
              as well as the complex evolutionary relationships between phages,
              moulded by the mosaicity of their genomes.",

              achieve strain-level characterization of complex microbial
              communities by capturing intra-species gene content variation.
              Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes
              that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many
              species are still not sequenced or have only few strains
              available. Binning co-abundant genes obtained from de novo
              assembly is a powerful reference-free technique to discover and
              reconstitute gene repertoire of microbial species. While current
              methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many
              accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain
              unassociated to core clusters. RESULTS: We introduce MSPminer, a
              computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes
              Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant
              genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust
              measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier
              to group and distinguish not only species core genes but
              accessory genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic
              dataset, MSPminer successfully delineates in a few hours the gene
              repertoires of 1661 microbial species with similar specificity
              and higher sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic
              annotation of MSPs reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and
              brings coherence in the nomenclature of the species of the human
              gut microbiota. The provided MSPs can be readily used for
              taxonomic profiling and biomarkers discovery in human gut

              count tables from other ecosystems to perform similar analyses.

              ecosystems. Exploration of viral assemblages is now possible
              thanks to the development of metagenomics, the most powerful tool
              available for studying viral ecology and discovering new viruses.
              Unfortunately, several sources of bias lead to the
              misrepresentation of certain viruses within metagenomics
              workflows, hindering the shift from merely descriptive studies
              towards quantitative comparisons of communities. Therefore,
              benchmark studies on virus enrichment and random amplification
              protocols are required to better understand the sources of bias.
              RESULTS: We assessed the bias introduced by viral enrichment on
              mock assemblages composed of seven DNA viruses, and the bias from
              random amplification methods on human saliva DNA viromes, using
              qPCR and deep sequencing, respectively. While iodixanol cushions
              and 0.45 $\mu$m filtration preserved the original composition of
              nuclease-protected viral genomes, low-force centrifugation and
              0.22 $\mu$m filtration removed large viruses. Comparison of
              unamplified and randomly amplified saliva viromes revealed that
              multiple displacement amplification (MDA) induced stochastic bias
              from picograms of DNA template. However, the type of bias shifted
              to systematic using 1 ng, with only a marginal influence by
              amplification time. Systematic bias consisted of
              over-amplification of small circular genomes, and
              under-amplification of those with extreme GC content, a negative
              bias that was shared with the PCR-based sequence-independent,
              single-primer amplification (SISPA) method. MDA based on random
              priming provided by a DNA primase activity slightly outperformed
              those based on random hexamers and SISPA, which may reflect
              differences in ability to handle sequences with extreme GC
              content. SISPA viromes showed uneven coverage profiles, with high
              coverage peaks in regions with low linguistic sequence
              complexity. Despite misrepresentation of certain viruses after
              random amplification, ordination plots based on dissimilarities
              among contig profiles showed perfect overlapping of related
              amplified and unamplified saliva viromes and strong separation
              from unrelated saliva viromes. This result suggests that random
              amplification bias has a minor impact on beta diversity studies.
              CONCLUSIONS: Benchmark analyses of mock and natural communities
              of viruses improve understanding and mitigate bias in
              metagenomics surveys. Bias induced by random amplification
              methods has only a minor impact on beta diversity studies of
              human saliva viromes.",

              RESULTS: Seven (46.7\%) of 15 patients with COVID-19 had stool
              positivity for SARS-CoV-2 by viral RNA metagenomic sequencing.
              Even in the absence of GI manifestations, all seven patients
              showed strikingly higher coverage (p=0.0261) and density
              (p=0.0094) of the 3' vs 5' end of SARS-CoV-2 genome in their
              faecal viral metagenome profile. Faecal viral metagenome of three
              patients continued to display active viral infection signature
              (higher 3' vs 5' end coverage) up to 6 days after clearance of
              SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory samples. Faecal samples with
              signature of high SARS-CoV-2 infectivity had higher abundances of
              bacterial species Collinsella aerofaciens, Collinsella tanakaei,
              Streptococcus infantis, Morganella morganii, and higher
              functional capacity for nucleotide de novo biosynthesis, amino
              acid biosynthesis and glycolysis, whereas faecal samples with
              signature of low-to-none SARS-CoV-2 infectivity had higher
              abundances of short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria,
              Parabacteroides merdae, Bacteroides stercoris, Alistipes
              onderdonkii and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 1\_1\_57FAA.
              CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides evidence for active and
              prolonged 'quiescent' GI infection even in the absence of GI
              manifestations and after recovery from respiratory infection of
              SARS-CoV-2. Gut microbiota of patients with active SARS-CoV-2 GI
              infection was characterised by enrichment of opportunistic
              pathogens, loss of salutary bacteria and increased functional
              capacity for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis and
              carbohydrate metabolism.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Comprehensive molecular profiling of various cancers
              and other diseases has generated vast amounts of multi-omics
              data. Each type of -omics data corresponds to one feature space,
              such as gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation, etc.
              Integrating multi-omics data can link different layers of
              molecular feature spaces and is crucial to elucidate molecular
              pathways underlying various diseases. Machine learning approaches
              to mining multi-omics data hold great promises in uncovering
              intricate relationships among molecular features. However, due to
              the ``big p, small n'' problem (i.e., small sample sizes with
              high-dimensional features), training a large-scale generalizable
              deep learning model with multi-omics data alone is very
              challenging. RESULTS: We developed a method called Multi-view
              Factorization AutoEncoder (MAE) with network constraints that can
              seamlessly integrate multi-omics data and domain knowledge such
              as molecular interaction networks. Our method learns feature and
              patient embeddings simultaneously with deep representation
              learning. Both feature representations and patient
              representations are subject to certain constraints specified as
              regularization terms in the training objective. By incorporating
              domain knowledge into the training objective, we implicitly
              introduced a good inductive bias into the machine learning model,
              which helps improve model generalizability. We performed
              extensive experiments on the TCGA datasets and demonstrated the
              power of integrating multi-omics data and biological interaction
              networks using our proposed method for predicting target clinical
              variables. CONCLUSIONS: To alleviate the overfitting problem in
              deep learning on multi-omics data with the ``big p, small n''
              problem, it is helpful to incorporate biological domain knowledge
              into the model as inductive biases. It is very promising to
              design machine learning models that facilitate the seamless
              integration of large-scale multi-omics data and biomedical domain

              typing purposes in the 1980s, but their use was short lived.
              However, the rise of C. difficile epidemics over the last decade
              has triggered a resurgence of interest in using phages to combat
              this pathogen. Phage therapy is an attractive treatment option
              for C. difficile infection, however, developing suitable phages
              is challenging. In this review we summarize the difficulties
              faced by researchers in this field, and we discuss the solutions
              and strategies used for the development of C. difficile phages
              for use as novel therapeutics. Epidemiological data has
              highlighted the diversity and distribution of C. difficile, and
              shown that novel strains continue to emerge in clinical settings.
              In parallel with epidemiological studies, advances in molecular
              biology have bolstered our understanding of C. difficile biology,
              and our knowledge of phage-host interactions in other bacterial
              species. These three fields of biology have therefore paved the
              way for future work on C. difficile phages to progress and
              develop. Benefits of using C. difficile phages as therapeutic
              agents include the fact that they have highly specific
              interactions with their bacterial hosts. Studies also show that
              they can reduce bacterial numbers in both in vitro and in vivo
              systems. Genetic analysis has revealed the genomic diversity
              among these phages and provided an insight into their taxonomy
              and evolution. No strictly virulent C. difficile phages have been
              reported and this contributes to the difficulties with their
              therapeutic exploitation. Although treatment approaches using the
              phage-encoded endolysin protein have been explored, the benefits
              of using ``whole-phages'' are such that they remain a major
              research focus. Whilst we don't envisage working with C.
              difficile phages will be problem-free, sufficient study should

              than 100 years. The reasons for longevity in this isolated region

              the role gut microbiota may play in healthy aging and longevity,
              we used metagenomic sequencing to determine the compositional and
              functional differences in gut microbiota associated with
              populations of different ages in Sardinia. Our data revealed that
              the gut microbiota of both young and elderly Sardinians shared
              similar taxonomic and functional profiles. A different pattern
              was found in centenarians. Within the centenarian group, the gut
              microbiota was correlated with the functional independence
              measurement of the host. Centenarians had a higher diversity of
              core microbiota species and microbial genes than those in the

              Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium rectale and enriched

              Moreover, functional analysis revealed that the microbiota in

              glycolysis and fermentation to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs),
              although the gut microbiota in centenarians was low in genes

              Centenarians as a model for extreme aging may help us understand
              the correlation of gut microbiota with healthy aging and
              longevity. Here we confirmed that centenarians had microbiota
              elements usually associated with benefits to health. Our finding
              of a high capacity of glycolysis and related SCFA production
              represented a healthy microbiome and environment that is regarded
              as beneficial for host gut epithelium. The low abundance of genes
              encoding components of pathways involved in carbohydrate
              degradation was also found in the gut microbiota of Sardinian
              centenarians and is often associated with poor gut health.
              Overall, our study here represents an expansion of previous
              research investigating the age-related changes in gut microbiota.
              Furthermore, our study provides a new prospective for potential

               sequencing enables the analysis of uncultivated microbial
               populations that may have important roles in their environments.
               Extracting individual draft genomes (bins) facilitates
               metagenomic analysis at the single genome level. Software and
               pipelines for such analysis have become diverse and
               sophisticated, resulting in a significant burden for biologists
               to access and use them. Furthermore, while bin extraction
               algorithms are rapidly improving, there is still a lack of tools
               for their evaluation and visualization. To address these
               challenges, we present metaWRAP, a modular pipeline software for
               shotgun metagenomic data analysis. MetaWRAP deploys
               state-of-the-art software to handle metagenomic data processing
               starting from raw sequencing reads and ending in metagenomic
               bins and their analysis. MetaWRAP is flexible enough to give
               investigators control over the analysis, while still being
               easy-to-install and easy-to-use. It includes hybrid algorithms
               that leverage the strengths of a variety of software to extract
               and refine high-quality bins from metagenomic data through bin
               consolidation and reassembly. MetaWRAP's hybrid bin extraction
               algorithm outperforms individual binning approaches and other
               bin consolidation programs in both synthetic and real data sets.
               Finally, metaWRAP comes with numerous modules for the analysis
               of metagenomic bins, including taxonomy assignment, abundance
               estimation, functional annotation, and visualization. MetaWRAP
               is an easy-to-use modular pipeline that automates the core tasks
               in metagenomic analysis, while contributing significant
               improvements to the extraction and interpretation of
               high-quality metagenomic bins. The bin refinement and reassembly
               modules of metaWRAP consistently outperform other binning
               approaches. Each module of metaWRAP is also a standalone
               component, making it a flexible and versatile tool for tackling
               metagenomic shotgun sequencing data. MetaWRAP is open-source
               software available at https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP .",
