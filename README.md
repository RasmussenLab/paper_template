## Description:

This is an Overleaf template that has some things needed for an initial submission to most journals, based on the requirements of Nature Publishing group. It is best suited for preparing an initial submission and a preprint. For the final submission, see the specific journal requirements.

The template includes:
- 1.5 spaced lines with line numbers (required for initial submission, easy to remove before publishing the preprint)
- Supplementary figures in its own file, with one figure per page, but possible to reference from the main text just like any other figure. Supplementary file also has a title, a list of figures with page numbers and all supplementary file pages are numbered, including the title page. The supplementary page numbers and supplementary figure numbers start with the prefix S.
- a selection of bibliography styles etc.
It’s an adaptation of the templates of Nature Publishing group. Also, don’t forget it’s possible to publish the preprint directly from the Overleaf interface

## Usage:
On Overleaf, click "New Project" -> "Import from GitHub". Alternatively, zip this folder and upload it to Overleaf manually. Then open `main.tex` file and compile. Edit as you wish.

## Project files:
1. **main.tex** - main document
2. **supplementary_figures.tex** - supplementary figures document
3. **sn-bibliography.bib** - the bibliography source file for main.tex.
4. **bst/** - a folder with bibliography styles (copy to the root folder to use)

See the comments in **main.tex** on how to apply different styles for initial submission and the preprint prublishing.
