# Thesis template

It's based on Joachim Johansen's thesis on phage genomics. The thesis has been 
stripped and could further be made less specific to the examples from the thesis.


## How to use

You can create the template from the repository using overleaf, see 
instruction on [how to create an overleaf project from an exisiting git repository](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Git_integration#Creating_an_Overleaf_project_from_an_existing_Git_repository).

The general workflow of thesis writing was:

1. Write the thesis core in a google doc with paperpile as reference manager.
2. Review and get feedback in google docs
2. Export the thesis when ready (either by copy-pasting or using pandoc) to overleaf
2. Export paperpile references from as a bibtex file from the google doc
3. Add back references, typeset and polish everything in overleaf
