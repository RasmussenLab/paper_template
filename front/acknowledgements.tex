\chapter{Acknowledgements}
Three years of computational science that worked out well has been condensed into this dissertation. For all the time that was not smooth sailing, I have been very lucky to have the support of many that I wish to acknowledge. First, a big thanks to Simon Rasmussen for all your support, energy and boundless enthusiasm for computational sciences and bioinformatics. Thanks to Søren Sørensen for co-supervision and for sharing your insights on microbiology. I would like to acknowledge all of my colleagues in the Rasmussen Lab who spent the entire or a great part of the time with me during this PhD. To the PhD-students of the group (Henry, Rosa, Marie Louise, Ricardo, Roman, Leonardo, Pau, Kirstine and Arnor) and postdocs (Jakob, Jonas, Lili, Katrine and Knud). Thanks for the many trips to the coffee machine, excessive cake meetings and amazing scientific retreat in Malta. Thanks to the CPR administration for supporting our scientific endeavors and to the SPA members for making all the hours at CPR more enjoyable with great events, beers and hygge.\\
I would also like to thank my collaborators and friends overseas. Thanks to Damian Plichta for many years of academic mentoring and collaboration, which started with running bash commands at Clinical Microbiomics and now a finished dissertation. Thanks to Hera Vlamakis who inspired me to take the final step and embark on the PhD. In addition, I am grateful to Ramnik J. Xavier for both his supervision and on-site and remote academic hosting during this PhD. Thanks to Thomas Pedersen and Eric Brown for sunny lunches and coffee breaks during my Autumn in Boston and also, by the way, doing three years of incredible lab work to verify my computational master thesis project and publish it. Furthermore, I wish to thank Kenya Honda and Koji Atarashi for their collaboration and inspiring work on human longevity and the microbiome. To my abroad-family in the US, Damian and Jesper, thanks for great hostmanship, superb company and slow mornings with several shots of espresso and long discussions on economy and technology.\\
Thanks to Christina for supporting me throughout all the ups and downs and painstakingly reading, editing, checking and \textit{regulating} this dissertation. Finally, thanks to my family and friends for your unconditional support during this journey.
